### Project rules for Cursor AI

This repo deploys the frontend to GitHub Pages via the existing workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` on **push to `main`**.

#### Slash commands (chat shortcuts)

When the user types a slash command, treat it as an instruction to execute the corresponding procedure.

##### `/deploy-prod`

Goal: trigger a production deployment (GitHub Pages) by pushing to `main`.

Procedure:
- Confirm there are intended changes: run `git status --porcelain`.
- Ensure we are on `main`. If not, ask before switching.
- Pull latest main safely: `git pull --rebase origin main`.
- Build locally to avoid breaking prod: `npm ci` then `npm run build`.
- Stage and commit:
  - `git add -A`
  - `git commit -m "chore(deploy): prod"`
  - If there is nothing to commit, do not create an empty commit; tell the user.
- Push to trigger CI/CD:
  - `git push origin main`
- Report:
  - Share the commit hash and remind the user to check GitHub Actions run “Deploy to GitHub Pages”.

Safety rules:
- Never print or request secrets in chat. Use GitHub Actions secrets already configured.
- If the build fails, do not push; fix the issue first.
- If the repo has untracked sensitive files (e.g. `.env.local`), never commit them.
